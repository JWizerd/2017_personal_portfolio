Ok that only happens sometimes but when it does it usually means I'm learning something really cool and it's going to be shortly followed by some type of dance.

        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>
          Speaking of web/software development here's what I'm currently up to: currently I spend my time as a Research and Development Software Engineer at <a href="http://madwire.com/">MadWire media</a>. MadWire is a rapidly growing marketing company that's considered to be the #1 place to work in the country as rated by Glassdoor. While I'd love to tell you all about what I do there and all of the awesome technology I get to learn and use, since I signed an non disclosure agreement if I told you that I'd have to have to kill you. Just kidding ðŸ˜œ. Let me just summarize by saying my role at the company is to create and maintain the internal software that helps automate the workflow of our 500+ employees. Prior to my current position I was one of the client facing fullstack developers at MadWire who specialized in our higher end custom website development, plugin development, eCommerce development and web applications. While I can't showcase the work I am currently doing you can view some of my past work created at MadWire and past work as a freelance web developer. <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/work">Check out the projects!</a> OR <span color="apple github-link">check out my github</span>!

        <h3>Philosophy of Work</h3>

        <p>
          I believe in working smarter not harder and I think all programmers should strive for laziness. Let me further explain so you don't think I just want to be a bum. I believe the more I can automate my software to make mine and my coworker's lives easier the happier everyone is and the less we all have to work. Which brings me to my next point, I believe firmly in a work life balance. I know the silicon valley engineers are looking down at me becuase I don't want to code 100 hrs a week but I do because there is a lot more to life than working in an office all day. Lastly, I believe that programmers (and anyone for that matter) need long periods of interupted time to maintain <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/199707/finding-flow">flow state</a> and the best creations are made when we can maintain this state each day. Hence, this is why it's a secret goal of mine to one day work remotely again. Don't get me wrong, I love where I work and the people I work with but the office environment is quite distracting and I know that my best work awaits when I get back to working in personal office again. NOTE: prior to MadWire I worked remotely for 4 years but you can read more about that in my <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/May-2018-Resume-Jeremiah-Wodke-general.pdf">resume</a>.

        <h3>About Me</h3>

        <p>
          In my spare when I'm not slowly evolving into an alien by progressively spending my existence in front of a computer I love exploring the great unknown with my beautiful wife and two dogs. I'm also some what of a music freak and enjoy going to concerts with my crew of close friends (Red Rocks!). When I'm not in nature or dancing at Red Rocks I save my time for personal projects, landscape photography and enjoying the presence of those few who can tollerate me (Love you fam).

          Now you may be wondering, what's the point of having a portfolio site if you have a great career already. I'll be the first to admit that I work at a great place but I fully understand that in this industry new and amazing opportunities are constantly coming out of the woodwork so to summarize the existence of this website; I'm always open to new opportunities so if you believe I would be a good fit for your team and the awesome things you guys are creating... <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/contact">hit me up ðŸ˜Š</a>
