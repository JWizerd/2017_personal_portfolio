          <span class="white">I love web development</span>. I have the greatest job in the world and the fact that I get to help other people too is a gift from God. Now, you may be wondering, "how can I help you?" I have been a full-time plus developer for almost 2 years and before that I was the director of marketing for 4 years at an agency who specialized in coroporate level marketing. In addition, I have a "modern education" to web development from attending numerous bootcamps and taking online courses to make sure that my development workflow is professional. I have a wide range of technical and graphic design skills including building custom themes for Wordpress, creating single page applications (like this website) and designing high-fidelity mock-ups in Photoshop. Bottom line, I know how to creat website that your customers are looking for.
