          <span class="white">I love web development</span>. I have the greatest job in the world and the fact that I get to help other people too is a gift from God. Now, you may be wondering, <span class="strong apple">"how can I help you?"</span> I have been a full-time plus developer for almost 2 years and before that I was the director of marketing for 4 years at an agency who specialized in coroporate level marketing. In addition, I have a "modern education" to web development from attending numerous bootcamps and taking online courses to make sure that my development workflow is professional. I have a wide range of technical and graphic design skills including building custom themes for <span class="apple">Wordpress</span>, creating single page applications (like this website) and <span class="strong apple">designing high-fidelity mock-ups in Photoshop</span>. Bottom line, I have the technical and marketing skill to create websites that your customers are looking for. <a class="contact" href="">Start a Project with me.</a>
