          <span class="white">I love web development</span>. I have the greatest job in the world and the fact that I get to help other people in such a creative and ever evolving field is a mission well accomplished. From custom PHP applications, JavaScript plugins and even ecommerce websites I have had a wide range of developer experience. While I am still considered "green" in the world of software engineering I believe my broad range of experience makes me easily adaptable to almost any programming niche.


          Now, you may be wondering, <span class="strong apple">"how can I help you?"</span> I have been a full-time plus developer for almost 2 years and before that I was the director of marketing for 4 years at an agency who specialized in coroporate level marketing. In addition, I have a "modern education" to web development from attending numerous bootcamps and taking online courses to make sure that my development workflow is professional. I have a wide range of technical and graphic design skills including building custom themes for <span class="apple">Wordpress</span>, creating single page applications and <span class="strong apple">designing high-fidelity mock-ups in Photoshop</span>. Bottom line, I have the technical and marketing skill to create websites that your customers are looking for. <a class="contact" href="{{site.baseurl}}/contact">Start a Project with me.</a>
