          <span class="white">I love web development like a fat kid loves cake.</span> There's never been something in my life that I've loved so much that also makes me want to pull my hair out! Ok that only happens sometimes but when it does it usually means I'm learning something really cool and it's going to be shortly followed by some type of dance.

          Speaking of web/software development here's what I'm currently up to: currently I have the privelage of spending my time working at <a href="http://madwire.com/">MadWire media</a>, a rapidly growing marketing company that's considered to be the #1 place to work in the country as rated by Glassdoor. While I'd love to tell you all about what I do there, if I told you that I'd have to have to kill you. Just kidding ðŸ˜œ. But to give you a brief summary my primarily role is helping maintaining and improve an existing monolothic codebase that helps automate the workflow of our talented marketing experts, client-facing web developers, graphic designers, sales people and more. I'm constantly learning about new technologies and every day is like drinking from a fire hose but I love it because I love solving hard problems and even more... I love solving hard problems with other people. What developer would I be if I didn't work on side projects to continuously try to improve my skillset so if you'd like to check out some of my personal work check out <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/work">my projects page</a> for a list of freelance projects  and projects I've completed at MadWire before being promoted to R&D Engineer which is where I am currently. OR you check out my latest <span color="apple github-link">github projects</span>!

          I'm big believer in work life balance. I know the silicon valley engineers are looking down but I am so In my spare when I'm not slowly evolving into an alien by progressively spending my waking existence in front of a computer I love exploring the great unknown with my courageous wife ðŸ—», going to shows with my crew of close friends (Red Rocks!), and enjoying the presence of those few who can tollerate my weirdness (Love you fam). Now you may be wondering, what's the point of having a portfolio site if you have a great career already. I'll be the first to admit that I work at a great place but I fully understand that in this industry new and amazing opportunities are constantly coming out of the woodwork so to summarize the existence of this website; if you have an opportunity that you feel is right up my alley or could use my expertise... <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/contact">hit me up ðŸ˜Š</a>
