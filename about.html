          I love web development! You know you've found a great career when you get so sucked into what you're doing that you blink and the work day is over. Or that when you go home after work you dream about your work and can't wait to get back to the office to test what you just dreamt about. It's relentless, constantly difficult, elegant (sometimes) and I couldn't see myself doing anything else.

        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>
          Currently, I spend my time as a Research and Development Software Engineer at <a href="http://madwire.com/">MadWire Media</a> a large and rapdily growing marketing company. While I signed a non-disclosure agreement and can't tell you much about what I do I can summarize it by saying this; I help build and maintain the internal web application that automates the workflows of our 800+ employees. It's a very fast paced environment but I've learned a ton! Prior to my current position I was one of the client facing full-stack developers at MadWire who specialized in our higher end custom website development, plugin development, eCommerce development and web applications. While I can't showcase the work I am currently doing you can view some of my past work created at MadWire and past work as a freelance web developer. <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/work">Check out the projects!</a> OR <span color="apple github-link">check out my github</span>!

        <h3>About Me</h3>

        <p>
          In my spare when I'm not slowly evolving into an alien by progressively spending my existence in front of a computer I love exploring the world with my beautiful wife and two dogs. I've created a great habit of always saving time for personal projects to grow my programming and design skillset.
