The UI utilizes custom developed APIs and JavaScript XHR to create a loadless interaction from beginning to end of the product customization. **Graphic Design was done by one of the talented designers at MadWire I just built the theme.",

    "techincalSpecs": "Estate Sales listings can be extremely content heavy. Large estate sale listings can have a minimum of 200+ images. Grason's Co. and their franchises needed an automated solution to distributing listings of this size to all of their external listing sites to improve their search engine optimization while eliminating the hours it took to manually to add content across the handful of estate sale websites and social networks not supported by third party software. Enter this project. Utilizing php and Guzzle, a http client for making external requests to third party APIs, I developed a wordpress plugin that would allow each of their franchises to manage all of their listings via the wordpress backend editor. Each time a custom estate sale post is made it is automatically posted to all external APIs of each franchise's choosing as well the ability to manage the deletion and updating of existing listings posted via the plugin on the external websites. This project was a catalyst to my promotion at MadWire into a research and development software engineer. **Graphic Design was done by one of the talented designers at MadWire I just built the theme.",
